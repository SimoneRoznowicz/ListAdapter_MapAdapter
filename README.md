# ListAdapter_MapAdapter
The project was done within the course Software Engineering offered at the Department of Information Engineering (DEI) at the University of Padua.<br/> <br/>
Supposing to be working in Java Micro Edition environment, precisely in ***CLDC1.1*** the objective consists of providing two adapters, namely *ListAdapter* and *MapAdapter*, equivalent to the ones present in ***J2SE 1.4.2***.<br/>
To accomplish the task, two adaptees were used: *Vector* and *Hashtable*.<br/>
63 total tests were successfully run using *Junit 4* framework, to ensure the correctness of the classes.<br/>
